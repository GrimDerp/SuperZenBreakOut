public class MazeCell : MonoBehaviour {

//We need a 3D visualization for our cells. Create a new game object named Maze Cell and add the MazeCell component to it.
//Then create a default quad object, make it a child of the cell and set its rotation to (90,0,0). 
//That gives us a very simple floor tile that fills the cell's area. 
//Turn the whole thing into a prefab, get rid of the instance, and give Maze a reference to it.
