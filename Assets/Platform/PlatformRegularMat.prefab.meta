//Advanced HTTP and HTTPS settings

//As mentioned, hubot uses node-scoped-http-client to provide a simple interface for making HTTP and HTTP requests. Under its hood, it's using node's builtin http and https libraries, but providing an easy DSL for the most common kinds of interaction.

//If you need to control options on http and https more directly, you pass a second argument to robot.http that will be passed on to node-scoped-http-client which will be passed on to http and https:

 // options =
 //   # don't verify server certificate against a CA, SCARY!
//    rejectUnauthorized: false
//  robot.http("https://midnight-train", options)
//In addition, if node-scoped-http-client doesn't suit you, you can can use http and https yourself directly, or any other node library like request.
